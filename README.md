# Why do we need another tool to manage the API Development Lifecycle?

* Shell scripts are good for small tasks, but they can become too complex to maintain and reuse as your API tasks grows. And Java, writing Maven plugins is no fun.
* Pluggable environment (thousands of npm and grunt modules and plugins)
* Grunt is perfect for adding those custom tasks in a heartbeat
* Pure JavaScript and Node.js. Enough said right :-)
* Compresses Node.js (node_modules, resources, and public directories)
* Compatible with all CI tools Jenkins, Bamboo, Go, Travis
* Ready for TDD with Mocha.js and Chai. See test directory.
* Includes static code analysis with (JSHint)[http://www.jshint.com/] and (ESLint)[http://eslint.org/]
* Easier to troubleshoot. cURL command support. using ```--curl```
* It's Compatible with Maven. See tools to enable Proxy Dependency Maven Plugin

# Directions to setup Grunt for an Apigee API Bundle

- [ ] setup Apigee Edge credentials as environment variables ae_username and ae_password.
- [ ] install [grunt cli](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli) ```sudo npm install grunt-cli -g```
- [ ] execute ```npm install``` to install all grunt dependencies
- [ ] add environments to Gruntfile.js under apigee_profiles config
- [ ] setup profiles element in apigee-config.js for each environment. Each environment will be referenced below as a flag e.g. --env={test, prod}
- [ ] setup config element in apigee-config.js for string replacements for each file

# Supported tasks

#### execute end-to-end lifecycle and overwrite revision (keep the same revision id)
```grunt --env=test --username=$ae_username --password=$ae_password --debug --curl=true```

**Note: debug flag to includes API responses.**

#### Test what you just deployed
Once previous is executed, you should be able to try the following calls:

##### Use apigee gateway and with Yahoo Weather standard Target
```
https://{org-env}.apigee.net/{api-basepath}/apigee/forecastrss?w=2502265
```

Example ```https://testmyapi-test.apigee.net/weathergrunt/apigee/forecastrss?w=2502265```

##### Use apigee gateway calling Yahoo Weather through Apigee Node.js as Target
```https://{org-env}.apigee.net/{api-basepath}/forecastweather_node/2502265
```

Example 
```
https://testmyapi-test.apigee.net/weathergrunt/forecastweather_node/2502265
```

##### Use apigee gateway retrieving static content through Node.js as Target
```https://{org-env}.apigee.net/{api-basepath}/images/tree.jpg
```

Example 
```
https://testmyapi-test.apigee.net/weathergrunt/images/tree.jpg
```

##### Use apigee gateway retrieving static content through Node.js as Target (nested folder)
```
https://{org-env}.apigee.net/{api-basepath}/tree.jpg
```

Example 
```
https://testmyapi-test.apigee.net/weathergrunt/tree.jpg
```

#### execute end-to-end lifecycle and keep last revision (increases revision id)
```grunt --env=test --username=$ae_username --password=$ae_password --debug --keep-last-revision=true```

#### get all deployed api revisions
```grunt getDeployedApiRevisions --env=test --debug```

#### undeploy api revision
```grunt undeployApiRevision:{revision_id} --env=test --debug```

#### undeploy api revision
```grunt deployApiRevision:{revision_id} --env=test --debug```

#### get all api revisions
```grunt getAllApiRevisions --env=test --debug```

#### import API bundle without deploying it
```grunt importApiBundle --env=test --debug --debug```

#### delete a revision
```grunt deleteApiRevision:{revision_id} --env=test --debug```

#### configuration management
See apigee-config.js file.

#### builds zip bundle under target directory
```grunt compress --env=test```

#### clean Target directory
```grunt clean --env=test```

#### check all tasks available
```grunt --help```

#### supported arguments and flags 
``` 
--username={apigee_edge_username} 
```

```
--password={apigee_edge_password}
```

```
--keep-last-revision
```

```
--skip-tests=true
```

```
--curl generate curl commands to be executed from command line
``` 

```
--override
```

```
--delay={seconds}
```

Node.js Deployment
====
In order to compress node.js modules, it's required node directory to exist in the root folder. By default node_modules, public, and resources are generated as part of the build. Compress configuration in Gruntfile.js can be modified to include any other configuration.

Continuous Integration with Jenkins
======
[This repo provides a guide for setting up an instance of Jenkins with Grunt](https://github.com/dzuluagaapigee/apigee-ci-jenkins-git-maven-jmeter) to deploy and configure an API bundle.

API Static Code Analysis
========
This plugin is enabled to provide feedback about coding best practices. 

JSHint
--------
JSHInt provides a large set of configurable (options)[http://www.jshint.com/docs/options/] that can be enabled out-of-the-box.
See jshint task in Gruntfile.js

ESHint
--------
ESLint provides an pluggable framework to enable static code analysis. In contrast to JSHint, ESLint can be extended to write custom API specific rules. See conf/rules/if-curly-formatting.js rule.  
See ESLint Gruntfile.js section

Reusability of code with Maven Plugins and shell scripts/command line tools
=====
Grunt plugin can be extended to support plugins, shell script or any other command line tools. For instance Proxy Dependency Maven Plugin includes an example of a [pom.xml](https://github.com/apigeecs/apigee-deploy-grunt-plugin/tree/master/tools/proxy-dependency-maven-plugin).

Contributing
=====
If you would like to contribute, simply fork the repository, push your changes to a branch and send a pull request.

Typo fixes, improvements to grammar or readability, it's all welcome.
